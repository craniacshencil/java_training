# For Queue
- add ,remove and element are not safe they throw exceptions
- offer, poll and peek are safe they return null values when the operation can't be performed 

# For Deque
- Its like a queue + stack
- along with offer, you have offerFirst and offerLast(offer and offerLast are essentially the same)
- has peek, peekFirst, remove, removeLast, poll, pollLast
- has removeFirstOccurence and removeLastOccurence methods, these methods return true or false depending on whether the item exists or not
- create an iterator with .iterator()

# Hashtable (without camelcase)
- Standard put table
